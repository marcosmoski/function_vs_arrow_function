# :hammer: Functions :vs: Arrow functions

- `Explanation:`: 
In JavaScript, both traditional functions and arrow functions serve the purpose of defining reusable blocks of code. However, they have some differences in terms of syntax, behavior, and contextual this binding.

- `Functions`: 
In functions the this binding is dynamically scoped, that means it changes depending on how the function is called. 
When a traditional function is used as a method of an object, this refers to the object the method was called on.
I can be used with constructors because it haves a prototype property
Can access the argumets object.

- `Arrow functions`: 
On arraow funcitons the this is lexically scoped, that means it have the value of this from the context when the arrow function is defined, regardless how or where it was called. 
Arrow functions are particularly useful when you want to maintain the value of this from the enclosing scope, such as in callbacks or event handlers.
It cannot be used with constructors, it doesnt have the prototype property
The arguments are present on the inherited function on lexical scope
